The PCCL custom fork of Fat Free CRM includes several alterations 
useful to us, which we do not wish to push back into the main
development branch. 

To date, the customisations include the following:

* config/settings.yml - modified the task_categories
* config/environment.rb - configured action_mailer.default_url_options
* app/views/accounts/* - renamed "Phone (toll-free)" labels to "VAT no."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please maintain this list as further customisations are added.
